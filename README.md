This is a app for purpose of learning [React Google Charts](https://github.com/RakanNimer/react-google-charts)

Note that this is a wrapper library around the base JavaScript library, [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/). You'll find a lot more information there as to how you can further customize your charts and visuals. In fact, in order to get the most from this library, its okay idea to go through the brief tutorial on the Google Charts website first. You'll likely be referring to it often.

This is using a React-Rails webpacker boilerplate w/ Postgress.
Setup commands
- `bundle` should do the trick
- `yarn install` if you need to install new node modules
- `rake db:create && rake db:migrate` to setup your DB

Server commands
- `rails server`
- `yarn start` (separate tab)

# Walkthrough

```javascript
import { Chart } from 'react-google-charts';

const LineChartExample = (props) => {
  let data = [
        ['Cohort Number', 'Awesomeness', 'Stress Levels'],
        ['53',  1000,      400],
        ['54',  1170,      460],
        ['55',  660,       1120],
        ['56',  1201,      602],
        ['57',  1250,      650],
        ['58',  1500,      630],
        ['59',  1030,      800]
      ]

  return (
    <div className={'my-pretty-chart-container'}>
      <div>
        <h2> Below is an example Line Chart</h2>
        <Chart
          chartType="LineChart"
          data={data}
          options={{}}
          graph_id="LineChart"
          width="100%"
          height="400px"
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default LineChartExample
```

There are a lot of charts to work with, but this library specifically works with the Google Charts API, which is arguably one of the easiest to use.

To render a google chart using this package, import that `"Chart"` component and render it, it's that simple! Then begin passing props based on the options you wish to designate for your chart, and the `Chart` component will interact with the Google Charts API for you.

Example Chart Props:
* chartTypes: accepts a string argument of the type of chart you wish to load. A list of charts can be found at Google Charts website.

* data: This prop is the simpler option that you have for passing an array of arrays representing columns and rows for your data. The first array is going to represent the headers or axes of your chart. Each additional array is going to represent a datapoint on that chart, with the first and second value corresponding the the x and y axis respectively.

*Alternatively, you can specify columns and rows to be more explicit about your data.*
* columns: This prop is used for setting up the column information of your table. It accepts an array of objects with keys corresponding to type, label and id of the column in question. Each additional object will represent the new info of each column.
https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference#DataTable_addColumn

* rows: Accepts an array of arrays, with each array representing the data point you wish to add (with two elements pointing to x and y values)
https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference#addrow

* options: this prop will be an object with keys that you can set based on the type of chart you are using. Usually, `title`, `height`, `width`, and `legend` are options available on most charts. This is where the bulk of customization will begin for the chart you wish to use.

#### Chart Events
Triggering callbacks based on user events is a little more involved than the rest of the library. A chart can also take an object with an array of event data objects. This will expose a `chartWrapper` object to you, which you will likely be calling `getChart` and `getSelection` on in order to retrieve information about the specific chart element you selected or interacted with.

```js
const chartEvents = [
  {
    eventName: "select",
    callback({ chartWrapper }) {
      console.log("Selected ", chartWrapper.getChart().getSelection());
    }
  }
];
```

I highly recommend you use the demo code below in your app in order to investigate the unique objects passed back to you. https://react-google-charts.com/user-selection
Unfortunately, they don't do an excellent job at telling us about this method we can call on each object that gets returned. However, you can see some of these methods here: https://github.com/rakannimer/react-google-charts/blob/cc749cf9ec8f8072c9965b1436b9f9547e147196/src/types.ts

Most likely, you would want to pass a different set of data to your chart based on a user interaction with your chart. So in this case, you would want to trigger your own callback function that will change state or make a new fetch for new data, and re-render the chart.


Below is a possible (untested) example.
```js
const chartEvents = [
  {
    eventName: "select",
    callback({ chartWrapper }) {
      const chart = chartWrapper.getChart()
      const selection = chart.getSelection()
      const [selectedItem] = selection
      const dataTable = chartWrapper.getDataTable()
      const { row, column } = selectedItem

      passNewData(row)
      // passNewData could take the row you clicked on, and use it to fetch new data from the backend. Then you setstate in your fetch and your chart should re-render.
    }
  }
];
```

To see more options about the chart you are using, go to your chart types specific options table.
https://react-google-charts.com/
**Note:** that `height`, `width` and a few other option keys can be passed in as their own props as well. You may have to dig into the Chart.js in the React Google Charts library to see what props are allowable, otherwise just pass them into the options object.

You should feel comfortable exploring each of the components that RakanNimer has defined, and see how the props he allows get passed to the Google Charts library.
